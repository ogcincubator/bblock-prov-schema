      this is a simple activity referencing some relevant document

      - language: json
        # this is referenced from complete examples using a $ref pattern following JSON schema approach
        ref: ../prov/examples/example-activity.json

  - title: Workflow (using LLM) Example
    content: |-
      A provenance chain for a workflow using a Large Language Model to interpret a query and and a geospatial data source.

      This is a fairly trivial example not attempting to standardise descriptions of such workflows, which would be an obvious profile for this model.
