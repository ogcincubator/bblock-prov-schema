name: JSON schema for W3C PROV model
abstract: Defines a standardised JSON schema for PROV ontology elements - supporting a graph structure based on an array of objects implementing PROV defined classes with object cross references.
description: |
  Provenance defined using the [W3C PROV-O model](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) is a DAG (non-cyclic graph) based on three main object types: Entity, Activity and Agent.
  
  This repository defines a JSON schema and matching JSON-LD context using the [OGC Building Blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/) methodology, 
  for W3C PROV-O model, using the canonical terminology used in the PROV ontology as element names.
  
  It also defines a context for an optional schema property "has_provenance" that can be used to wrap a provenance graph as an array of such objects, to extend the property prov:wasGeneratedBy (whose range is one or more Entity objects) with an explicit schema.

  Note that the PROV working group originally defined a number of JSON serialisation options, however these have limited uptake and do no allow PROV-O to annotate other schemas. This implementation uses modern JSON schema and JSON-LD mechanisms to provide a complete mapping from JSON to PROV-O model.
